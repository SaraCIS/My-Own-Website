Hey Sara your website is looking great! I love the theme you chose with your site it fits the topic well.
I also like that your website has no shortage of information. One thing i would change is to center your navigation menu
instead of having it off to the left. One other thing i would change is maybe adding a little bit of text spacing on your
Facts and Names pages. Other than that your site is coming along great.

Loving the colors and the information is to the point the only thing I would say is that it needs some pictures of the different
types of dragonflies. Also, the wording on the bottom of the home page on the right side is kinda throwing me off a bit. Also,
in the blog, try to make the paragraph on the far left fit within that one column.


Changes Made:  2. Spaced out text on "Facts" and "Names" pages
               3. Pictures of the different types of dragonflies
