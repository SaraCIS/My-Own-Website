    <h1>Welcome to the Blog of Mine That Now Exists.</h1>

    <h2>I will need columns for my "<em>Blog of Mine that Now Exists.</em>" So let's do it!</h2>

    <article>
        <p>I am not sure about why this blog exists. But since it does now, let's make the best of it.</p>
        <p>There are things that can be said, and the choice is always there as to whether or not we will say it. I need
            to say something so that I may pass this class. For this blog is part of my
            assignment for this week. I need enough words so that this paragraph may be broken up into columns and look
            like it's something worth reading. Therefore, I shall continue to write so that
            this blog may now exist.</p>

        <p>People can be interesting organisms. Some like to talk; some like to write. While others... well, they like
            to breathe. It's interesting that not one person is the exact same duplicate of
            another. Science may argue with this statement by boasting about their abilty to clone any organism that
            they may want to in their labs. This may make another person an exact replica of someone
            else physically, but are they really the same in how they will think and respond to situtations given where
            they are and what they have to face at any given time?</p>

        <p>This conludes what I will write in this "Blog of Mine That Now Exists" at this time. It is just the
            conclusion at this time and may change in the very near future. So if you have any desire to be
            intrigued, may you potentially find it in this "Blog of Mine That Now Exists". So maybe you are not
            intrigued today, but the future also exists. At least for me, especially since I still decide
            to breathe and no one is hindering my decision, and I hope that no one will EVER hinder my decision. So come
            back next time if you want to be intrigued. There is no guarantee that you will be, but the potential will
            definitely be there. So be
            nice to yourself until I get to see your eyeballs again.</p>
