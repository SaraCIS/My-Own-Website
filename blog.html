        <p class="bold">--- My First Blog Post, so Hi. --- </p>

        <p>I am not sure about why this blog exists. But since it does now, let's make the best of it.</p>
        <p>There are things that can be said, and the choice is always there as to whether or not we will say it. I need
            to say something so that I may pass this class. For this blog is part of my
            assignment for this week. I need enough words so that this paragraph may be broken up into columns and look
            like it's something worth reading. Therefore, I shall continue to write so that
            this blog may now exist.</p>

        <p>People can be interesting organisms. Some like to talk; some like to write. While others... well, they like
            to breathe. It's interesting that not one person is the exact same duplicate of
            another. Science may argue with this statement by boasting about their abilty to clone any organism that
            they may want to in their labs. This may make another person an exact replica of someone
            else physically, but are they really the same in how they will think and respond to situtations given where
            they are and what they have to face at any given time?</p>

        <p>This conludes what I will write in this "Blog of Mine That Now Exists" at this time. It is just the
            conclusion at this time and may change in the very near future. So if you have any desire to be
            intrigued, may you potentially find it in this "Blog of Mine That Now Exists". So maybe you are not
            intrigued today, but the future also exists. At least for me, especially since I still decide
            to breathe and no one is hindering my decision, and I hope that no one will EVER hinder my decision. So come
            back next time if you want to be intrigued. There is no guarantee that you will be, but the potential will
            definitely be there. So be
            nice to yourself until I get to see your eyeballs again.</p>

        <p class="bold">--- Another day; another assignment. ---</p>

        <p>So I believe that I just have finished the requirements for the Module 7 Assignment that is due today. I was
            worried that I wasn't going to
            get it done on time. I had an issue with how to have the grid layout that I chose be applied to my website
            appear properly
            on every page. I was stuck
            on it for a good hour, I think, but I fortunately realized that I needed to step away and come back to it
            and I did just that.</p>

        <p>I bought myself some pho and Vietnamese coffee to eat as a late lunch meal. Then, after I was done and
            relaxed for a bit, I came back to the assignment and I could see the issues that I had almost right away. I
            had
            mislabeled some coding and I needed
            to have a header section on my other pages and not just my home page and blog pages. When I got the code in
            for the header sections, my pages all
            looked more uniform. That was just what I was shooting for!</p>

        <p>I have had many teachers during my days as a student that have given me the advice to take a break if I
            cannot solve something and try again after
            I have allowed myself to step away. It seems to work for me very well as long as I remember to do so.
            Though, I wouldn't say that
            all of the advice that I have received from my teachers were constructive. Some have proven to be
            detrimental to me.</p>

        <p>During high school and junior college, it seems like the number one advice that teachers give is to ask
            questions. It made me feel dumb because many
            seem to require that I ask questions prior to having the material ever being presented. I never seem to know
            what I should
            be asking. For I don't even know what I am supposed to know.</p>

        <p>It wasn't until I've stopped going to school formally and actually tackled life on my own by working
            full-time, and overtime during
            many instances, and learning what I am responsible for and what I am not responisble for in my life that I
            realized that it's okay to
            not have any questions. I wasn't dumb for not knowing what to ask. I needed to learn how to identify my
            problems first before I can
            develop any questions to find any solutions that I may need. I've even developed a desire to <em>want</em>
            to find solutions to problems during my time away from school. Hence, I'm very excited
            about this cybersecurity program that I've decided to enroll in. I'm looking forward to have problem solving
            be a daily occurence for me.
        </p>

        <p>Also, I noticed that when I do ask questions, the answers provided is not always what I expect, and it made
            me feel
            stupid. Then, I would test
            my answers and find out that they aren't necessarily always "wrong" either. So, I have found that there are
            many problems that do have more
            than one solution to each one of to them. Though, the answer might not have been accepted by the majority,
            but it
            actually made answers to my
            other questions or problems
            easier to solve. But, let that be my secret.(wink)</p>
